Yuu
===

*Yuu* is a pure functional wrapper for Apache POI. It is loosely inspired by
*doobie*, *Anorm* and others. In its current state it is mostly a draft of a
collection of ideas.

The current goals include:

 - Provide a pure way of composing actions on workbooks and sub-entities
 - Ease data extraction with a parsing DSL
 - Allow interop with Scalaz, Cats, reactive streams and others
